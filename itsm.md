## 1. Overview

ITSM helps businesses build structure around the lifecycle of IT services, from creation to management and upkeep.

IT service management (ITSM) is a set of policies, processes and procedures to plan, deliver, operate and support of customer-oriented IT services. 

Businesses usually move their operations to different cloud providers to meet different needs. They also use different cloud strategies depending on their goals. The key points of ITSM are IT efficiency, managing change, self service and automated services.

## 2. Background

 There are multiple frameworks that fall under ITSM, and some address unique industry-specific IT needs, including those in healthcare, government or technology. Businesses using ITSM consider IT as a service, with a focus on delivering valuable services to customers, rather than a department that manages technology.
     
### 2.1 Atlassian suite
#### Jira

Jira is a project management software popular among many companies of different sizes. With a really high score and user satisfaction rate, it is currently one of the top project management solutions. Jira usually ships with Confluence, and can be combined with many other tools from its family or third parties.

Confluence is meant to complement JIRA to draw out the macro picture. Confluence is the plain language macro vision store, tool of choice for design and documentation, while JIRA acts as the bridge between the likes of Bitbucket and Confluence. One popular configuration for large enterprises is Jira + Confluence + Bitbucket
 
JIRA, like GitHub and GitLab, is an execution and delivery tool.
