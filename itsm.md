## 1. Overview

ITSM helps businesses build structure around the lifecycle of IT services, from creation to management and upkeep.

IT service management (ITSM) is a set of policies, processes and procedures to plan, deliver, operate and support of customer-oriented IT services. 

Businesses usually move their operations to different cloud providers to meet different needs. They also use different cloud strategies depending on their goals. The key points of ITSM are IT efficiency, managing change, self service and automated services.

## 2. Background

 There are multiple frameworks that fall under ITSM, and some address unique industry-specific IT needs, including those in healthcare, government or technology. Businesses using ITSM consider IT as a service, with a focus on delivering valuable services to customers, rather than a department that manages technology.
     
### 2.1. Jira Service Desk

Jira Service Desk is another product by Atlassian that complements popular issue tracking platform. 

Jira Service Desk is intuitive and easy to implement. For smaller organizations, it can help meet simple requirements without becoming too complex for business users outside IT, and for organizations that do need more complex systems, Jira Service Desk is easy to customize and can help streamline workflows — even in an agile environment.

The Confluence add-on for Jira Service Desk uses machine learning to direct customers and employees to the right service through an online help center. It learns from each experience, so that it can get better at recommending solutions to users. You can also access Jira Service Desk on a mobile device, making it easier for IT workers to stay productive.

 - Gartner PeerInsights rating: 4.2 stars
 - Target audience: Smaller businesses with fewer ITSM requirements
 - Notable features: Machine learning services; user-friendly mobile version
 - Pricing: Accounts start at $10 per month for up to 10 users, and $7 per month for 11-100 users. For 100+ users, you’ll need to get a custom quote.

### 2.2. ServiceNow

ServiceNow is a born-in-the-cloud SaaS and platform offering that started out focusing on ITIL-based IT service management applications.

ServiceNow offers a cloud-hosted IT management platform that helps businesses to manage and maintain their IT infrastructure. It offers deeper insights into incidents and depreciation in the organization, on top of service desk management. It’s designed to help streamline complex IT environments and to deliver insights through sleek, organized reports that can be customized.

ServiceNow’s IT management software is geared towards larger organizations with complex IT environments. The navigation interface isn’t as intuitive or user-friendly as others on this list and since it comes with so many features, you’ll have to take time to figure out which services suit your needs. 

It is usually the ticketing and self-service platform of choice for large enterprises, as an addition to their Atlassian suite.

- Gartner PeerInsights rating: 4.2
- Target audience: Larger organizations with complex IT - infrastructures
- Notable features: Organizes incidents so you can find common themes or issues, not very user friendly.
- Pricing: Quote based only.

### 2.3. Zendesk

Zendesk is a user-friendly and comprehensive IT ticketing system that is easy to implement and maintain. Zendesk also regularly pushes updates and adds new features, so the product can grow with your company.

The Zendesk suite includes Support, Guide, Chat and Talk — you can buy the entire suite or you can purchase each service individually. Support helps you track and solve customer’s support needs; Guide helps you deliver self-service answers to customers; Chat lets you engage in real-time with customers; Talk helps you provide phone support and connect helps you virtually solve customers’ issues.

Zendesk is more cost effective for smaller companies and really easy to get running with. As we scale, using Zendesk becomes a bit more difficult.

- Gartner PeerInsight rating: 4.3
- Target audience: Small to midsize organizations
- Notable features: Straightforward pricing and customization - options
- Pricing: The entire Zendesk suite (including Support, Guide, Chat and Talk) starts at $89 per user per month, but you can also choose individual services provided in the suite. The monthly fee for Support ranges from $5 to $200 per user; free to $29 for Guide; free to $59 for Chat; and free to $89 for Talk. Each individual product has its own pricing tier to choose from, with most offering a free lite version of the software.
